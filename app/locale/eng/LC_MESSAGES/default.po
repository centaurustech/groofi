For example: You’re a fashion designer and you want to launch a new clothing line and you need 5,000 US$ to do so. Here are a few examples of what you might offer in return for the donation: For 20 US$, the backer gets an exclusive t-shirt from the new line For 40 US$, the backers gets a belt from the new line For 50 US$, a top etc… you get the picture!"

Groofi is open only to finite projects."

msgid "DEFINE_YOUR_PROJECT_CONCEPT_2"
msgstr "With a precisely defined goal, expectations are transparent for both the creator and potential backers. Backers can judge how realistic the project’s goals are, as well as the project creator’s ability to complete them.

It's important to have both small and big rewards – small ones should be oriented to individuals and small sponsors, while big rewards should focused directly to any potential big, corporate sponsor."

msgid "CREATE_AWARDS_11"
msgstr "So what works? Offering something of value. Actual value considers more than just sticker price. If it’s a limited edition or a one-of-a-kind experience, there’s a lot of flexibility based on your audience. But if it’s a manufactured good, then it’s a good idea to stay reasonably close to its real-world cost. In the other hand, defining rewards for corporate sponsors is different, as you're basically offering potential forms of promotion. You have to focus on what would be attractive for a company's marketing manager – in other words, how your project can be a potential channel to promote, position, and even sell a brand."

msgid "CREATE_AWARDS_12"
